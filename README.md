This dataset is used for anonymous review.

The dataset comes from 2800 CAN signals collected on the CAN bus. After careful sorting, we divided them into normal signals and abnormal signals. Among them, there are 2400 normal signals, which come from signals from 8 benign devices on the CAN bus. The abnormal signals include 400, each from signals from intrusion devices in eight attack scenarios.
